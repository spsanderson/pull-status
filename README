This project is going to be used to pull in specified status updates 
from social networks such as Twitter. Pulling in news articles along 
with blog posts and comments and public Facebook posts and comments to 
be added over time.

The program will work as follows:

The user is asked to input username and password for their Twitter account
The user is asked to input a search term in the following format 'term'
Results will pull from Twitter and be put inside of a text file.

**The results then need to be put into a database this is where I am having trouble.**

If you would like to contribute to the project I encourage it, lets turn 
this into the default framework for pulling in information for text 
analysis.
